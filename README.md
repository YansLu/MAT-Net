# DR & MAT-Net
Facial Expression Recognition (FER) in the wild remains a challenging task due to the strong commonality among different categories and the disturbance caused by occlusion, pose variation, etc. To achieve effective Facial Expression Recognition (FER), we propose a representation optimization strategy, termed as Decomposable Representation (DR) and embed it into a novel  Multi-level Gobal Amending and Local Relation-ware Representation (MAT-Net).
